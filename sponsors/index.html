        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>We aim to be the leading platform for sustained philanthropy within the Bay Area Chinese American community, using a model of continuous stakeholder education and collaboration to engage both the communityâ€™s donors and the organizations they support.</p>

            <br>
            <li>3. We aim to create a donor community that advances innovative solutions to challenging problems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Bay Area is home to numerous Asian-American communities, many of whom have unique needs requiring targeted resources from within the community itself. While there are local organizations providing this assistance, there existed few services to ensure their survival. After seeing even the most innovative organizations struggle year after year, a small group of dedicated community leaders developed the idea for a platform that could not only support these organizations but also work in tandem with them to identify and sustain future programs.</p>
        
        <p>The Chinese American Community Foundation would be more than a charitable vehicle for donors; it would be a holistic resource for stakeholders on both sides of the grantmaking process. Informed by the depth of their own civic engagements and a close network of local non-profits, professional advisors, and donors, the founders envisioned a framework for more impactful philanthropy within the Chinese-American community. Its goal is to create a community of donors who will invest in the growth of the endowment, respond to the changing needs of the Bay Area, and strengthen leaders and organizations for generations to come.</p>
