        <p id="event5">It is common knowledge that China has a long history and glorious history in both arts and traditional crafts. These are just two of the many jewels in China's over five thousand-year culture. The arts and crafts are not only the embodiment of the people's longing for aesthetic beauty for themselves and as gifts for others, but also great treasures for China and the rest of the world. Many of the master artisans have had their skills handed down via one generation to the next so that only the offspring of such an artisan could learn the necessary skills required. The result being that they are the most valuable treasures both for a family and for the nation. In this workshop we will teach you how to make fans, lanterns, kites, paper-cutting, shadow puppets, pottery and write calligraphy</p>

        <p id="event9">Join us for a spectacular evening of dazzling lights, colors, shapes, and themes. The Lantern Light festival is a six-week celebration of Chinese culture featuring massive lanterns, inspiring performances, and incredible cuisine. A tradition that started over 2000 years ago, the lantern festival is China’s most important celebration, making the return of spring, with the lighting of Chinese lanterns being symbolic of illuminating the future and the reunion of family. While many people picture lanterns being released in to the night sky, these enormous lanterns stay firmly on the ground. Each Chinese lantern is custom-built by Chinese artisans and typically takes four weeks and a team of seven to complete. The lanterns appear to be three-dimensional stained glass and are handmade from hundreds of pieces of silky cloth. Some are over 30 feet high and others are up to 300 feet long. If you enjoy an evening full of festive lights and amazing sights, bring your family to the Chinese hao wan festival, a rare opportunity to witness the majestic skill of the world’s best lantern maker. </p>
